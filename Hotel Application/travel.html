	<div><p class="de">Attanagalla Rajamaha Viharaya is one of the most famous ancient royal temples in Sri Lanka. According to legend, King Sri Sangaboâ€™s brother Gothabhaya (249-262 A.D.) built a Stupa (Pagoda) at the place where his brother, Sri Sangabo, made the great sacrifice of giving his head in gratitude for a favor he received from a poor and ordinary countryman. But now Archeologists believe that the location is probably the HatthikucchiVihara Complex which is located about 40 kilometers away from Anuradhapura.</p></div>

	<div><p class="de">The Kelaniya Raja MahaVihara or Kelaniya Temple is an important and historic Buddhist temple, 28.2 kms from Hotel Royal. Buddhists believe the temple to have been hallowed during the third and final visit of the Buddha to Sri Lanka, eight years after gaining enlightenment. Its history would thus go back to before 500 BCE.The Mahawansa (history of the Sinhalese) records that the original stupa at Kelaniya enshrined a gem-studded throne on which the Buddha sat and preached. The temple flourished during the Kotte era but much of its land was confiscated during the Portyguse occupation of the island. Under the Dutch colonist, however, there were new gifts of land and under the patronage of King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha the temple was rebuilt. It was refurbished in the first half of the 20th century. The temple is also famous for its image of the reclining Buddha and paintings by the Sri Lankan artist Solias Mendis which depict important events in the life of the Buddha, in the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, also incidents from the Jataka tales. An 18-foot stone statue of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara has been erected at the temple.</p></div>
